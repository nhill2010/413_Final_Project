## PROJECT DESCRIPTION ##
This document is about the game Perseus: New Frontier. Perseus: New Frontier is a Tower Defense game. This game will have 3 different levels that will have 10 waves of enemies that will try and evade the player’s defenses and reach the Colony. When the Colony runs out of health you lose the game. You will have to place Heroes to defend the Colony and keep it from losing health. There will be 3 different Heroes and 4 different enemy types. 



## GAMEPLAY CONCEPTS ##
#### Goal ####
The goal of the game is to get to the end of wave ten and beat the last enemy with the most health left. Health is lost when an enemy reaches Colony. The more gold and health you have at the end the better you do.
#### Losing ####
You will lose the game when your Colony loses all HP before wave 10. The Colony loses health when an enemy gets to it.
#### User Skill ####
The game is a simple strategy game so you will need some basic strategy. You will gain money and you will need to know when to use it and when to save. You will use the mouse to place and upgrade units.
#### Level Progression ####
Each wave will gain more and more enemies of hard types and then wave ten will have all kinds of enemies. The first couple waves will be of a couple weaker enemies that you will get gold for so you can place more heroes. The harder the enemy the more gold you get so the more you can place and upgrade the heroes. The 3 different levels will have a different path for the enemies to go and make it harder depending on the level.
